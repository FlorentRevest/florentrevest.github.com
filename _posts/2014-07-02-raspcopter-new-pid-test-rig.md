After the lessons of the last article, the Raspcopter now has a brand new test rig. This time, the rotation is really blocked on an angle and the quadcopter can not lift anymore. It now becomes much easier than before to adjust the variables of the PID.

This new test rig consists of two trestles supporting a solid metal axis around which the drone is hooked and can rotate.

We can already observe much more satisfactory results while the PID gains in this video were selected coarsely.

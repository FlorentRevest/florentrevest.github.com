      I created and maintain an open-source operating system for smartwatches named [AsteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org/). I have been an embedded Linux consultant for a couple of years for automotive and mobile companies. [At Bootlin](https://bootlin.com/blog/support-for-the-allwinner-vpu-in-the-mainline-linux-kernel/), I started the Allwinner VPU device driver now in the Linux kernel.

      At the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (*NTNU*), I turned a KIA Niro into a self-driving car using [Baidu Apollo](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/apollo). Few years ago, I built a [drone with a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/Raspcopter) and programmed its flight system and ground control station from scratch.

    introduction: |
      I was previously an intern at ARM Cambridge, working on [firmware sandboxing](https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/8/25/108) and memory protection hypervisors. I wrote [my own x86 kernel](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/Quasar) back when I was a teenager. I [extended Valgrind](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/valgrind) to model a process' memory accesses as graphs.

      I worked on [LIDAR Simultaneous Localization And Mapping for autonomous driving](https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer_ros/pull/952) at EasyMile. I wrote a [video anonymization tool](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/anonymize-video). I reimplemented the [OpenCV face detection](https://github.com/FlorentRevest/ViolaJones) algorithm. I worked as a teaching assistant in the "*Computer Vision and Deep Learning*" class of NTNU.

    introduction: |
      I strive to appreciate beauty around me. I find that having a camera around the neck is a great way to force myself to pay more attention to my surroundings. I share a selection of my favorite shots (mostly wildlife, landscapes and architecture) on [my Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/florent_revest/).

      I like [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), [progressive metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJUDk6a4GsI) and playing the piano. Younger, I made some electronics projects like a Bluetooth speaker out of my toothbrush box, I also built a universal remote control to annoy TV sales clerks. I participated in WCPS (ICPC training), Google Code In and Code Jam.
